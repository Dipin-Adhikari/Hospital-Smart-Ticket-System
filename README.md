# Hospital Smart Ticket System

## Introduction

Hospital overcrowding is a major problem in hospitals in developing countries. The manpower in the hospital is less in ratio compared to the patients. The number of increasing patients and manpower every year in the hospital are not equal. Patients have to stay in the queue in every ward and for every service. Overcrowding may affect patients' symptoms, clinical outcomes, and satisfaction. It can also affect physicians' effectiveness, causing frustration among medical staff.

So this project focus on solving the staff issue by replacing/adding robots instead of humans/staff. As robots can perform given instructions faster than humans, using robots for cutting hospital tickets can help in reducing the crowd.

This project is divided into main two parts:
- First part is to store the data of patients in a database and generate QR Code. 
- Second part is to extract data from QR Code and generate the ticket.
## Implementation
To implement it practically, we can use the raspberry pi as the main controller. This project is also tested on raspberry pi 4. As the data entry is done by the staff of the hospital. So we need to make a robot only to generate tickets by extracting data from QR Code. The project is not completed yet. The ticket file is needed to be printed, so we need a printer. And this project is mainly for governmental hospitals which offer free OPD services to patients, so there is no involvement of money. 

## Conclusion

Concluding the project is capable of cutting tickets in hospitals. It can reduce the crowds and make the hospital more systematic. It directly affects the people as they neednâ€™t stay in long lines and reduces the workload from the staff.

## Improvement
Although this project is for governmental hospitals where OPD services are free but it can also be used in private hospitals. For this, we need to add a feature for receiving, recognizing, and returning the excess money.
